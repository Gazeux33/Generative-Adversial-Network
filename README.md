 ## What is GANs ?

### Generator

The role of the **Generator** is to create images that appear realistic enough to fool the Critic.

- **Objective**: Produce images that mimic the original dataset.
- **Functioning**: It takes a random noise vector and transforms it into an image.
- **Expected Outcome**: That the Critic cannot distinguish the generated images from those actually from the dataset.

### Critic (or Discriminator)

The **Critic**'s task is to differentiate generated images from real images from the dataset.

- **Objective**: Correctly identify whether an image is generated by the Generator or is from the original dataset.
- **Functioning**: It evaluates images one by one and delivers its verdict.
- **Expected Outcome**: Maximize its ability to make the correct distinction.
